# Detecting-Insults
## John Fulgoni - 29 March 2016

Attempting a challenge from Kaggle.

The goal is to make a one-class classifier to determine if certain tweets are insults.
One of the hints given is that the classification tends to overfit.

Currently gets 0.745749905553 correct from basic training and classifying. Will try to improve later.
